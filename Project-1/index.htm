               <p>One of the most important revolutionaries in the <strong>  Indian Nationalist Movement </strong> is Bhagat Singh.
                 On September 28, 1907, Kishan Singh and Vidyavati gave birth to Bhagat Singh in Banga, 
                 Lyallpur District (now Pakistan). When he was born, his uncles Ajit and Swaran Singh, 
                 as well as his father Kishan Singh, were all imprisoned for protesting the 1906 Colonization Bill. 
                 Being raised in a politically conscious household where his family supported the Ghadar party, 
                 young Bhagat Singh developed a sense of patriotism.</p>
